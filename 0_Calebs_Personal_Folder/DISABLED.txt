From the docs (collateral.md):

Defaulted Collateral must stay defaulted.
If status() ever returns CollateralStatus.DISABLED, then it must always return CollateralStatus.DISABLED in the future.

// Is there a way to set the status to IFFY or SOUND again, after it has been
// set to disabled in the past? If so, that's a medium/high severity issue
