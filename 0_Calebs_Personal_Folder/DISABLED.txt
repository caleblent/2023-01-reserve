From the docs (collateral.md):

Defaulted Collateral must stay defaulted.
If status() ever returns CollateralStatus.DISABLED, then it must always return CollateralStatus.DISABLED in the future.

// Is there a way to set the status to IFFY or SOUND again, after it has been
// set to disabled in the past? If so, that's a medium/high severity issue

FOUND: in the "function markStatus(CollateralStatus status_) internal {" of
FiatCollateral.sol, there is this check on line 183:
	  if (_whenDefault <= block.timestamp) return; // prevent DISABLED -> SOUND/IFFY
on lines 194-196, this is what sets it so:
	} else if (status_ == CollateralStatus.DISABLED) {
            _whenDefault = uint48(block.timestamp);
        }
